### MasterDexter ReactJS Hackathon 2022

#### Build a landing page for startups including the following features:

1. Conversion intent: Make an offer people will actually convert on. E.g. Top of the funnel vs. bottom of the funnel visitors need different CTAs
2. Single conversion goal: Your landing page offers a clear path to conversion. Just one, not many 
3. Message match: Ad copy, message, offer, and tone match landing page copy, message, offer, and tone 
4. Headline/subheadline: Your headline explains the value you’ll provide, and the promise you’ll make; your subheadline introduces your product or service and explains how you’ll create value and deliver your promise
5. Visuals: Images, graphics, and video make the invisible visible and provide context to your value proposition
6. Features/benefits: Not just how you’ll do it, but why it matters
7. Social proof: Shows that other people in the same situation chose you, and makes your offer believable
8. Form: For lead gen startup pages, your form captures critical lead info so sales can follow up
9. Call-to-action: Nudges prospects toward the next step in your conversion path
10. 1:1 Attention ratio: Visitors get distracted easily. Limit the number of links on your landing page to as close as possible. 
11. Irresistible offer: Without an irresistible offer, nothing else matters. Make it matter.
